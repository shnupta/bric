TAGS FUNCTIONALITY USAGE DOCUMENTATION v0.0.1

Ctags is a UNIX tool, that along with a text editor which can use it, makes it easy to navigate large source code projects.
It provides features such as the ability to jump from the current source file to definitions of functions and structures in other files.  
Ctags also supports many languages besides C.

Ctags is first run on its own to generate a "tags" file, then it is invoked from within the editor.

First of all cd into your project source code directory.

Run the command :  
	ctags -R *

This should generate the "tags" file.

Open the source code file and place cursor over the function, structure, structure member, class member or macro whose definition you want to navigate to.

CTRL_M : Navigates you to the definition of the identifier under the cursor.

CTRL_N : Brings you back.

You can use CTRL_M multiple times, in nested way, for functions using other functions and then use CTRL_N equal number of times, to come back.

This functionality heavily relies on the "tags" file which in turn depends on the UNIX tool "ctags".
Reading manual page of ctags (run 'man ctags') will help user understanding this in more depth.
