# TAGS

bric supports the use of searching tags generated by Exuberant Ctags
(ctags)<http://ctags.sourceforge.net/>.

ctags is capable of generating tags for all types of C/C++ language
tags, including all of the following:

    class names
    macro definitions
    enumeration names
    enumerators
    function definitions
    function prototypes/declarations
    class, interface, struct, and union data members
    structure names
    typedefs
    union names
    variables (definitions and external declarations)

Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found in
source files that allows these items to be quickly and easily located
by a text editor or other utility. A tag signifies a language object
for which an index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index
entry created for that object).

Some ctags programs generate a tags file that isn't compatible with
bric. You can check by using `ctags --version`. The output should be
similar to this:

    Exuberant Ctags 5.9~svn20110310, Copyright (C) 1996-2009 Darren Hiebert
    Addresses: <dhiebert@users.sourceforge.net>, http://ctags.sourceforge.net
    Optional compiled features: +wildcards, +regex

On some systems, the program might be `ctags-exuberant`. Many Linux
distros off the `exuberant-ctags` package in their repositories.

Once you've verified you have the correct `ctags` program, you can
create a tags file:

    Change to the top level of your source code directory
    Enter `ctags -R .` (or 'ctags-exuberant')

Now, when you run bric from the same directory as the tags file and
open a source code file from that level on down, you'll be able to use
bric's tag searching feature.
